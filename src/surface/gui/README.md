# gui

## Overview

This package is for all the code related go the driver station gui. The gui is comprised of our custom widgets found in the gui/widgets folder. For connecting our gui with the rest of the ROS network we have implemented nodes which communicate between pyqt and ROS found in gui/event_nodes. Lastly we have the app.py which is the a custom super class which inherits from ROS Node and PyQT QWidget. Then operator_app.py and pilot_app.py inherit from App to make each custom gui.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyqt6 pyqtdarktheme opencv-python opencv-python-headless
```

## Usage

Run the operator gui with

```bash
ros2 launch gui operator_launch.py
```

Run the pilot gui with

```bash
ros2 launch gui pilot_launch.py
```

### Timer

A simple start and stop timer that counts down from 15 minutes.

### Video Widget

A widget to display video. There are two subclasses of the video widget: `PauseableVideoWidget` adds pausing the video stream and `SwitchableVideoWidget` enables toggling between video feeds.

#### Subscribed Topics
